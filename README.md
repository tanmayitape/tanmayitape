### Profile

I am a data analyst with a strong focus on decision-oriented analytics, business intelligence, and data-driven problem solving. My work sits at the intersection of data, business context, and clear communication, helping stakeholders make confident, evidence-based decisions.

I have experience working with complex, imperfect datasets and turning them into reliable insights through structured analysis, rigorous validation, and well-designed reporting. I value accuracy, clarity, and practicality over unnecessary complexity.
